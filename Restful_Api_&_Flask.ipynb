The significance of the Flask-RESTful extension is that it simplifies building RESTful APIs by providing tools and a structured approach for Flask development, enabling cleaner, object-oriented code, automatic handling of requests and responses, and built-in support for common API functionalities like request parsing and error handling. This makes it easier for developers to quickly create robust APIs that adhere to REST principles with minimal boilerplate code."

        "ANS. Flask's session object provides a way to store user-specific data, like login status or user preferences, across multiple browser requests by using cryptographically signed cookies. It functions like a Python dictionary, allowing you to set and get data, but it is crucial to set a strong SECRET_KEY for security, as this key is used to sign the cookie. The session data resides in the browser as a cookie, and it is automatically decoded and re-encoded with each request to maintain the user's state.\n"
